Multi-Modal RAG MVP - Local Document Intelligence System
A lightweight, end-to-end multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline capable of processing text, tables, and images from real-world PDFs, powered locally using Ollama (no API cost).

Project Overview

This project implements a Multi-Modal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system designed to handle complex documents containing:

Text

Tables

Figures & charts

Scanned images

OCR-extracted content

It answers user questions by extracting and retrieving relevant sections from the document and generating context-grounded answers using an LLM.

The entire pipeline runs locally and does not require OpenAI API or paid keys.

Key Features

Feature	Description

Multi-modal ingestion	Extracts text, tables, images, OCR, metadata from PDFs

OCR Support	Uses Tesseract for scanned pages

Chunking	Smart semantic + structural chunking

Vector Embeddings	Uses Ollama embeddings (nomic-embed-text or similar)

Vector Store	FAISS-based retrieval

Query Engine	Retrieves top-k chunks from vector store

Local LLM	Uses Llama 3.1 / Mistral in Ollama for grounded QA

Streamlit UI	Clean interface for upload → question → answer

Source Citations	Each answer includes page-level references

System Architecture

PDF -> Multi-modal Extractor -> Chunker -> Embeddings -> Vector DB (FAISS) -> Query -> Retriever -> LLM -> Answer

Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

Streamlit

PyMuPDF

Pytesseract (OCR)

FAISS

Ollama (Llama 3 / Mistral)

LangChain components (optional)

⚙️ Installation

1️ Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️ Install and run Ollama
winget install Ollama.Ollama
ollama run llama3

3️ Install Tesseract (if OCR required)

Windows installer:
https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

▶️ Run the App

streamlit run src/app.py

Evaluation

This system has been tested for:

Text-only PDFs

PDFs with tables

Scanned-image PDFs

Mixed multi-modal documents

Accuracy is significantly improved due to chunk-aware retrieval and multimodal embeddings.
